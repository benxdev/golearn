- converting arrays to slices:
    slice := array[:]
    slice := array[:2]
    (taking a slice from an array has the same memory sharing properties as taking a slice from a slice).

- converting slices to arrays
    using type conversion:
    array := [length]int(slice)
    (the memory is not shared in the case. changes to slice won't affect array and vice versa).
    
    - converting a slice to an array pointer
    arrayPointer := (*[length]int)(slice)
    (the memory is now shared in this case).
